## Conversation

```
sjaca10: Let's create a new project for an Applicant Tracking System called LTI-ATS-JACA.

We must follow the best practices and industry standard for our project.

We need to create the basic structure to have our project ready to run and contributed by another developers.

Our project will contain the backend and frontend folders with all the structure, requirements and needs for each side.

Our tech stack will be:
- backend
  - Typescript
  - Node
  - Express
  - PostgreSQL
- frontend
  - Typescript
  - React

We must follow these design patterns: DDD, TDD.

Before proceed creating everything, what else do you think is needed?
```

GitHub Copilot: Before proceeding with creating the project structure for LTI-ATS-JACA, consider the following additional elements:

1. **Version Control**: Initialize a Git repository to manage the project's version control. This will help in tracking changes and collaborating with other developers.

2. **Project Management Tool**: Decide on a project management tool (like Jira, Trello, or GitHub Projects) for task tracking and sprint planning.

3. **Coding Standards and Linters**: Establish coding standards for TypeScript both in the backend and frontend. Configure linters (like ESLint) and formatters (like Prettier) to enforce these standards automatically.

4. **Dependency Management**: Use a package manager like npm or yarn to manage project dependencies. Ensure to create `package.json` files in both backend and frontend directories.

5. **Environment Variables**: Plan for the use of environment variables to manage sensitive and environment-specific configurations (like database connection strings).

6. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins. This will automate testing and deployment processes.

7. **Testing Frameworks**: Since TDD is a requirement, choose appropriate testing frameworks for both backend (like Jest for Node) and frontend (like Jest and React Testing Library for React).

8. **Docker**: Consider containerizing your application with Docker to ensure consistency across different development and production environments.

9. **Documentation**: Start with a README file for both backend and frontend, outlining the project setup, architecture, and contribution guidelines.

10. **Security Practices**: Plan for security best practices, including setting up HTTPS, using security headers, and safeguarding against common vulnerabilities.

11. **Database Migrations Tool**: For managing PostgreSQL database changes, consider using a migration tool like Flyway or Sequelize migrations.

12. **API Documentation**: Use tools like Swagger or Postman for documenting your RESTful APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and consume your backend services.

13. **Authentication/Authorization Strategy**: Decide on an authentication and authorization strategy (like JWT, OAuth) for securing your application.

14. **Error Handling and Logging**: Implement a consistent error handling and logging mechanism across your application for easier debugging and monitoring.

15. **Internationalization and Localization (i18n and L10n)**: If your application will serve users in multiple languages, plan for internationalization and localization.

16. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the frontend is responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.

17. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Configure CORS in your backend if your frontend will be hosted on a different domain.

18. **Performance Optimization**: Consider strategies for optimizing performance, such as code splitting in React and efficient querying in PostgreSQL.

19. **Scalability Planning**: Think about how your application will scale, both in terms of infrastructure and database.

20. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up monitoring and alerting tools to keep track of application health and performance issues.

These considerations will help in setting a solid foundation for your project, ensuring it is scalable, maintainable, and ready for collaboration.

```
sjaca10: What are some popular TypeScript linters and formatters that can be used to enforce coding standards?
```

GitHub Copilot: For TypeScript projects, the following linters and formatters are popularly used to enforce coding standards:

1. **ESLint**: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript code. With support for TypeScript through a parser and plugin, ESLint can enforce a wide range of coding standards and stylistic choices.

2. **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that supports many languages, including TypeScript. Prettier enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

3. **TSLint**: Previously the standard linter for TypeScript, TSLint has been deprecated in favor of ESLint. The TypeScript team announced that they would be focusing their efforts on supporting TypeScript in ESLint. While some projects may still use TSLint, new projects are encouraged to use ESLint.

4. **TypeScript ESLint**: A monorepo for all the tooling which enables ESLint to support TypeScript. This includes the `@typescript-eslint/parser` and various `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` rules that are TypeScript-specific.

5. **EditorConfig**: While not a linter or formatter in the traditional sense, EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. It's often used alongside linters and formatters to enforce basic stylistic preferences.

For most TypeScript projects, a combination of ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting is recommended. This combination ensures that code not only adheres to best practices and avoids common errors (as enforced by ESLint) but also looks consistent (as enforced by Prettier). Integration with IDEs like Visual Studio Code can further streamline the development process by providing real-time feedback and automatic formatting on save.

```
sjaca10: What are some popular testing frameworks for TypeScript?
```

GitHub Copilot: For TypeScript projects, several testing frameworks are popularly used to ensure code quality and reliability. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

1. **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. It works well with TypeScript for both unit and integration tests. Jest provides a zero-configuration setup, built-in code coverage tools, and supports mocking out of the box. Use `ts-jest` for seamless integration with TypeScript.

2. **Mocha**: A flexible testing framework for JavaScript, Mocha can be used with TypeScript by adding a TypeScript compiler as a dependency (like `ts-node`) and configuring Mocha to compile TypeScript files before running tests. It's often paired with assertion libraries like Chai.

3. **Chai**: While not a testing framework itself, Chai is a popular assertion library that can be used with testing frameworks like Mocha or Jest. It provides a range of interfaces (e.g., `expect`, `should`) for writing test assertions in a readable manner.

4. **Jasmine**: An older framework that influenced many other testing libraries. It's an all-in-one solution providing assertion functions, test double utilities (spies, stubs), and a test runner. Jasmine can be used with TypeScript by configuring it to compile TypeScript files before tests are run.

5. **AVA**: A test runner for Node.js that works well with TypeScript. It's minimalistic but powerful, supporting modern JavaScript features out of the box. AVA emphasizes concurrency, minimalism, and speed, making it a good choice for projects valuing these aspects.

6. **Karma**: A test runner developed by the AngularJS team that can execute tests in real browsers. It's often used for running tests written in Jasmine, Mocha, or QUnit. Karma is not tied to a specific testing framework, so it can be used with TypeScript as long as the tests are compiled first.

7. **Cypress**: An end-to-end testing framework that can test anything that runs in a browser. While it's JavaScript-based, it supports TypeScript out of the box, making it a popular choice for testing web applications, including those written in TypeScript.

8. **Playwright**: A framework for testing web applications across modern browsers. It supports end-to-end testing and works well with TypeScript, providing a powerful API for automating, testing, and verifying web applications.

When choosing a testing framework for a TypeScript project, consider the type of testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) you'll be doing, the complexity of your setup, and how well the framework integrates with the rest of your development tools.

```
sjaca10: What are some popular tools for documenting RESTful APIs in TypeScript?
```

GitHub Copilot: For documenting RESTful APIs in TypeScript projects, several tools are popularly used to create clear, interactive, and maintainable API documentation. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

1. **Swagger (OpenAPI)**: Swagger, now known as the OpenAPI Specification, is one of the most widely used tools for documenting APIs. It allows developers to define APIs in a YAML or JSON format, generating interactive API documentation that developers can use to test endpoints directly. The `swagger-ui-express` and `tsoa` packages can be used to integrate Swagger with Express applications written in TypeScript, automatically generating OpenAPI specifications from your TypeScript code.

2. **TypeDoc**: TypeDoc is a documentation generator for TypeScript projects. It runs on your TypeScript codebase and generates documentation pages, allowing you to document your API in the code itself using comments. While it's more general-purpose and not specifically tailored for RESTful API documentation, it's useful for documenting the TypeScript interfaces and classes that make up your API.

3. **API Extractor + API Documenter**: API Extractor helps you manage and roll up your TypeScript declarations, and it can generate an API report file that tracks changes in your public API surface. Coupled with API Documenter, it can generate documentation websites from the output of API Extractor. This combination is particularly useful for large TypeScript projects needing detailed documentation of their exported APIs.

4. **Compodoc**: Compodoc is a documentation tool for Angular applications but can be used for any TypeScript project. It provides a comprehensive overview of your application's structure, including components, directives, modules, services, pipes, and documentation coverage. For RESTful APIs specifically built with Angular, Compodoc can offer valuable insights into the architecture and dependencies.

5. **JSDoc with TypeScript**: JSDoc is a popular tool for documenting JavaScript code. When used with TypeScript, JSDoc comments can be added directly to your TypeScript code, and tools like `tsd-jsdoc` can generate JSDoc documentation from TypeScript definitions. This approach allows for documenting RESTful APIs in a manner similar to TypeDoc, leveraging JSDoc's widespread use and familiarity among developers.

6. **Redoc**: Redoc provides a customizable and responsive web template for displaying OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications. It works well with specifications generated from TypeScript projects and offers a clean, interactive interface for API documentation. Redoc can be easily integrated into your project's build process to automatically generate and serve API documentation.

When choosing a tool for documenting RESTful APIs in TypeScript, consider the complexity of your API, your documentation workflow, and the preferences of your development team. Tools like Swagger/OpenAPI are particularly well-suited for RESTful API documentation due to their focus on API specification and testing.

```
sjaca10: What are some popular tools for end-to-end testing in TypeScript?
```

GitHub Copilot: For end-to-end testing in TypeScript projects, several tools are popularly used to ensure that applications work as expected from a user's perspective. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

1. **Cypress**: Cypress is a powerful tool for writing end-to-end tests in JavaScript or TypeScript. It provides a rich set of features for testing modern web applications, including automatic waiting, real-time reloads, and access to network traffic. Cypress has first-class support for TypeScript, making it a popular choice for TypeScript-based projects.

2. **Playwright**: Developed by Microsoft, Playwright is a framework for testing web applications across Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. It supports end-to-end testing and works well with TypeScript, offering type definitions out of the box. Playwright enables testing of a wide range of web applications, including single-page applications, traditional multi-page applications, and mobile web apps.

3. **Selenium WebDriver**: Selenium is a well-established tool for automating web browsers. It supports multiple programming languages, including TypeScript, through its WebDriver API. While it may require more setup and configuration compared to some newer tools, Selenium's extensive ecosystem and browser support make it a versatile choice for end-to-end testing.

4. **TestCafe**: TestCafe is a node.js tool for automating end-to-end web testing. It's easy to set up and use, requires no webdrivers, and supports testing on remote devices and cloud services. TestCafe has built-in TypeScript support, allowing you to write tests in TypeScript directly without additional configuration.

5. **Puppeteer**: Puppeteer is a Node library developed by the Chrome DevTools team. It provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. While primarily used for browser automation and scraping, Puppeteer can also be used for end-to-end testing. TypeScript definitions are included in the Puppeteer package, facilitating its use in TypeScript projects.

6. **Jest with Puppeteer**: For projects already using Jest for unit and integration testing, combining Jest with Puppeteer for end-to-end testing can be a powerful setup. This combination allows you to leverage Jest's testing framework and matchers together with Puppeteer's browser automation capabilities. The `jest-puppeteer` package simplifies the integration of Jest and Puppeteer, and it can be used with TypeScript by configuring Jest to handle TypeScript files.

When choosing an end-to-end testing tool for a TypeScript project, consider factors such as the complexity of your web application, the browsers you need to support, and your team's familiarity with the tooling. Tools like Cypress and Playwright are particularly popular in the TypeScript community for their ease of use, robust feature sets, and excellent TypeScript support.

```
sjaca10: What are some popular tools for generating code coverage reports in TypeScript projects?
```

GitHub Copilot: For generating code coverage reports in TypeScript projects, several tools are popularly used to measure the extent to which the source code is executed during testing. This helps in identifying untested parts of a codebase. Here are some of the most commonly used tools:

1. **Istanbul (nyc)**: Istanbul is a widely used JavaScript code coverage tool that works well with TypeScript when combined with a transpiler like `ts-node` for executing TypeScript directly or by precompiling TypeScript to JavaScript. `nyc`, the command-line interface for Istanbul, can instrument your TypeScript code for coverage reporting without additional setup for transpilation.

2. **Jest**: Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity, and it supports TypeScript out of the box with the help of `ts-jest`. Jest comes with built-in code coverage reporting. You can generate coverage reports by simply adding the `--coverage` flag when running your tests. Jest's coverage reports are powered by Istanbul under the hood.

3. **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing, Cypress can generate code coverage reports for your TypeScript projects. This requires additional setup, including instrumenting your application code using tools like `@cypress/code-coverage` plugin, which works in conjunction with Istanbul.

4. **Karma**: Karma is a test runner that can work with various testing frameworks like Jasmine, Mocha, and QUnit. For TypeScript projects, you can use Karma in combination with the `karma-coverage` plugin to generate code coverage reports. The setup typically involves precompiling TypeScript to JavaScript and may use `karma-typescript` for both compiling and bundling TypeScript files directly.

5. **Codecov**: Codecov is not a code coverage generator itself but a tool that provides highly integrated tools to group, merge, archive, and compare coverage reports. You can use it in conjunction with any of the above tools that generate coverage reports (like Istanbul/nyc or Jest) to visualize coverage changes and enforce coverage standards in your TypeScript projects.

6. **Coveralls**: Similar to Codecov, Coveralls works with your continuous integration service to track your TypeScript project's code coverage over time. It integrates with the coverage reports generated by tools like Istanbul/nyc or Jest, providing a detailed breakdown of coverage changes and statistics.

When choosing a tool for generating code coverage reports in TypeScript projects, consider your testing framework, the complexity of your setup, and your continuous integration workflow. Tools like Jest might be preferred for projects already using it for testing due to its built-in coverage reporting, while Istanbul/nyc offers flexibility for projects using other testing frameworks.

```
sjaca10: What are some popular tools for generating API documentation from TypeScript code?
```

GitHub Copilot: For generating API documentation directly from TypeScript code, several tools are popularly used to create clear, interactive, and maintainable documentation. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

1. **TypeDoc**: TypeDoc is a documentation generator that turns TypeScript source code and comments into readable HTML documentation. It is one of the most popular tools for TypeScript projects due to its ease of use and integration with TypeScript's type system.

2. **TSDoc**: TSDoc provides a standardized way to document TypeScript source code. While TSDoc itself is not a tool for generating documentation, it defines a syntax that can be used with documentation generators like TypeDoc to ensure consistent and meaningful documentation across TypeScript projects.

3. **Swagger (OpenAPI) with TypeScript Annotations**: For RESTful API documentation, Swagger (now known as OpenAPI) is widely used. Tools like `tsoa` or `nestjs/swagger` for NestJS projects allow you to use TypeScript decorators to annotate your controllers and services, and then automatically generate OpenAPI documentation for your API. This approach is particularly useful for web applications and services where documenting the API endpoints, parameters, and responses is crucial.

4. **API Extractor and API Documenter**: API Extractor is a tool that provides API review and extraction for TypeScript projects, creating an API report file that tracks changes in the public API. Combined with API Documenter, it can generate documentation websites from the API data extracted by API Extractor. This combination is useful for large TypeScript projects needing detailed documentation of their exported APIs.

5. **Compodoc**: Although Compodoc is more commonly associated with Angular projects, it can also be used for general TypeScript documentation. It generates a static documentation website, including coverage reports, dependency graphs, and more, from your TypeScript and Angular source code comments.

6. **JSDoc with TypeScript Support**: JSDoc, traditionally used for JavaScript documentation, can also be used with TypeScript. By leveraging JSDoc comments in TypeScript code and using the TypeScript compiler option `--declaration` to generate `.d.ts` files, you can use JSDoc or tools like `better-docs` plugin for JSDoc to generate documentation for your TypeScript project.

When choosing a tool for generating API documentation from TypeScript code, consider the nature of your project (e.g., whether it's a library, a RESTful API, or an Angular application), your documentation workflow, and the preferences of your development team. Tools like TypeDoc and Swagger with TypeScript annotations are particularly well-suited for TypeScript projects due to their integration with TypeScript's type system and support for modern web application development.

```
sjaca10: What are some popular tools for mocking dependencies in TypeScript unit tests?
```

GitHub Copilot: For mocking dependencies in TypeScript unit tests, several tools are widely used to simulate the behavior of real objects, making it easier to isolate the code under test. Here are some of the most commonly used mocking libraries and tools in the TypeScript ecosystem:

1. **Jest**: Jest is not only a testing framework but also provides a powerful mocking system. It allows you to easily mock functions, modules, and classes. Jest's auto-mocking capability is particularly useful, and its API supports the creation of manual mocks for more complex scenarios. Since Jest supports TypeScript out of the box, it's a popular choice for TypeScript projects.

2. **ts-mockito**: Inspired by the Java library Mockito, ts-mockito is a TypeScript mocking library that allows you to create mock objects and stub methods or properties. It offers a strong typing system and fluent API, making your tests more readable and maintainable.

3. **Sinon.js**: Sinon is a standalone testing library for JavaScript, and it works well with TypeScript too. It provides functions to spy on, stub, and mock objects and functions. Although it doesn't offer TypeScript-specific features, its comprehensive functionality for mocking, combined with type definitions available through `@types/sinon`, makes it a solid choice for TypeScript projects.

4. **TypeMoq**: TypeMoq is a mocking library specifically designed for TypeScript. It leverages TypeScript's advanced type system to provide strongly typed mocking, including support for interfaces, which can be challenging to mock in JavaScript. TypeMoq's API is expressive and allows for easy setup of mocks and verifications.

5. **ts-jest**: While `ts-jest` is primarily a Jest transformer for TypeScript, enabling Jest to process TypeScript files, it's worth mentioning in the context of mocking because it ensures that Jest's mocking capabilities work seamlessly with TypeScript code, including type checking of mocks.

6. **ts-auto-mock**: ts-auto-mock is a library that provides automatic type-safe mocks for TypeScript interfaces and types with zero configuration. It uses the TypeScript compiler API to generate mocks directly from types, which can significantly speed up the process of writing tests by reducing the need for manual mock creation.

When choosing a tool for mocking dependencies in TypeScript unit tests, consider the complexity of your dependencies, the level of type safety you need, and how well the tool integrates with your existing testing framework. Tools like Jest and ts-mockito are popular for their ease of use and strong community support, while libraries like TypeMoq and ts-auto-mock offer more TypeScript-specific features for projects that require advanced type safety in their tests.

sjaca10: @workspace create the docker componse with a PostgreSQL instance, a .env file must be created to securely store the username and password credentials for PostgreSQL. Set a secure password.
```

Workspace: To set up a Docker Compose file with a PostgreSQL instance and use a `.env` file for securely storing the username and password credentials, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project directory and add the following content. Make sure to replace `your_secure_password` with a secure password of your choice.

```env
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file** in the root of your project directory with the following content. This file defines a service named `db` that uses the official PostgreSQL image. It also specifies that the PostgreSQL service should use the environment variables from the `.env` file.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

3. **Run the Docker Compose** setup by executing the following command in your terminal:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This command starts the PostgreSQL instance in detached mode. The PostgreSQL service will be accessible on the default port `5432`, and it will use the username and password specified in the `.env` file.

Remember to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to your version control system, as it contains sensitive information.

```
sjaca10: Generate the code to connect to the PostgreSQL database
```

GitHub Copilot: To connect to a PostgreSQL database in a Node.js application, you can use the `pg` package. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Install the `pg` package** by running:

```sh
npm install pg
```

2. **Create a new file** for your database connection, e.g., `db.js`.

3. **Use the following code** in `db.js` to set up the connection. This code assumes you have environment variables for your database connection details. You should have the `dotenv` package installed and configured in your project to use environment variables from a `.env` file.

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');

// Load environment variables
require('dotenv

').

config();

const pool = new Pool({
  user: process.env.POSTGRES_USER,
  host: process.env.POSTGRES_HOST,
  database: process.env.POSTGRES_DB,
  password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
  port: process.env.POSTGRES_PORT,
});

module.exports = {
  query: (text, params) => pool.query(text, params),
};
```

4. **Configure your [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/.env") file** with the necessary PostgreSQL connection details:

```env
POSTGRES_USER=your_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_database
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

5. **Use the database connection** in your application. For example, to execute a query:

```javascript
const db = require('./db');

async function getUser(id) {
  const { rows } = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id]);
  return rows[0];
}
```

This setup provides a basic structure for connecting to and querying your PostgreSQL database from a Node.js application.

```
sjaca10: @workspace generate the files and code to connect to the PostgreSQL database
```

Workspace: To connect to the PostgreSQL database from the backend service in your project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Install the necessary package**: Since your backend is using Node.js and Express, and you already have the `pg` package listed as a dependency in your [`backend/package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/package.json"), ensure it's installed by running:

```sh
cd backend
npm install
```

2. **Create a database configuration file**: Create a new file in your backend service directory, for example, `backend/src/db.ts`. This file will contain the code to connect to your PostgreSQL database using the `pg` package.

```typescript
// backend/src/db.ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

const pool = new Pool({
  user: process.env.POSTGRES_USER,
  host: 'localhost',
  database

:

 'your_database_name', // Replace with your actual database name
  password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
  port: 5432,
});

export const query = (text: string, params?: any[]) => pool.query(text, params);
```

3. **Use the database connection**: You can now use the `query` function exported from `backend/src/db.ts` to interact with your PostgreSQL database from anywhere in your backend code. Here's an example of how you might use it in an Express route:

```typescript
// Example usage in an Express route (e.g., backend/src/routes/sampleRoute.ts)
import express from 'express';
import { query } from '../db';

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/data', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const result = await query('SELECT * FROM your_table_name'); // Replace with your actual table name
    res.json(result.rows);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).send('Server error');
  }
});

export default router;
```

4. **Update your `.env` file**: Make sure your `.env` file contains the correct PostgreSQL user and password. You've already set these, so ensure they match the credentials of your PostgreSQL instance.

5. **Update your `.gitignore`**: Verify that your `.gitignore` file in the root directory includes the `.env` file to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control.

By following these steps, you've created the necessary files and code to connect to your PostgreSQL database from the backend service of your project. Remember to replace placeholders like `your_database_name` and `your_table_name` with your actual database and table names.

```
sjaca10: @workspace provide the command to create the backend dir structure to follow the DDD pattern
```

Workspace: To create the backend directory structure following the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) pattern, you can use the following commands. This structure includes directories for entities, repositories, services, and controllers, which are common in DDD to separate concerns and organize code around the business domain.

```sh
cd backend/src
mkdir -p domain/entities
mkdir -p domain/repositories
mkdir -p application/services
mkdir -p infrastructure/db
mkdir -p interfaces/controllers
mkdir -p interfaces/http
```

This structure is explained as follows:

- `domain/entities`: Contains the domain models (entities) of your application, which are the core business objects.
- `domain/repositories`: Interfaces for the repositories that abstract the data layer, allowing for decoupling from the infrastructure.
- `application/services`: Application services that contain business logic and orchestrate the flow of data between the domain and infrastructure layers.
- `infrastructure/db`: Infrastructure implementations, including database access logic (e.g., your existing [`db.ts`](backend/src/database/db.ts) could be moved here if it fits better with your DDD structure).
- `interfaces/controllers`: Controllers that handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate to application services.
- `interfaces/http`: Setup and configuration for your HTTP server and routes.

Remember, DDD is flexible, and you can adjust this structure as needed to fit the complexities and specific requirements of your application.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD) File Structure

The project follows a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach, particularly in the backend. Here's how the file structure is organized to support DDD:

- `application/`: Contains service layer logic that orchestrates domain objects to perform the operations of the application.
- `domain/`: Contains the business logic and entities. This is the heart of the DDD approach, where the business domain is modeled.
  - `entities/`: Contains the domain entities, which are the fundamental objects of the business domain.
- `infrastructure/`: Contains implementations of the interfaces defined in the domain layer, such as repositories for database access.
- `interfaces/`: Contains interfaces that define contracts for services, repositories, etc., that are implemented in the infrastructure layer or used in the application layer.

sjaca10: @workspace initialize git and execute the first commit
```

Workspace: To initialize Git and execute the first commit in your project, follow these steps in the integrated terminal of Visual Studio Code:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project if you are not already there.
2. Initialize the Git repository:

```sh
git init
```

3. Add all files to the staging area. Since you have `.gitignore` files already set up, Git will respect those rules and not add ignored files:

```sh
git add .
```

4. Commit the added files to the repository:

```sh
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

This will create the initial commit with all the files currently in your project, excluding those specified in `.gitignore` files.

```

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

```typescript
// File: backend/application/health.ts
import { Router, Request, Response } from 'express';
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const router = Router();
const pool = new Pool({
  // Your database connection settings
});

router.get('/', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    await pool.query('SELECT 1'); // Simple query to check if the database is connected
    res.status(200).send('OK');
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Database connection failed');
  }
});

export { router };
```

```
sjaca10: How can I configure ESLint and Prettier for my TypeScript project?
```

GitHub Copilot: To configure ESLint and Prettier for your TypeScript project, follow these steps:

1. **Install ESLint and Prettier**: It looks like you already have ESLint and Prettier installed along with their respective plugins and configurations. If not, you can install them using npm:

```sh
npm install eslint prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier --save-dev
```

2. **Initialize ESLint**: Run the following command to initialize ESLint. This will create an `.eslintrc` file in your project where you can specify your ESLint rules.

```sh
npx eslint --init
```

During initialization, you can choose to use a popular style guide, which can be Airbnb, Google, or Standard. For a TypeScript project, make sure to select "To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style" and "TypeScript" when prompted.

3. **Configure Prettier**: Create a `.prettierrc` file in your project root. This file will contain your Prettier configuration. Here is a basic example:

```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 80,
  "tabWidth": 2
}
```

4. **Integrate Prettier with ESLint**: To make ESLint and Prettier work together, you need to adjust your `.eslintrc` file to include the Prettier plugin and extend the Prettier configuration. Here is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "prettier"
  ],
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint", "prettier"],
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "error"
  },
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2020,
    "sourceType": "module"
  }
}
```

5. **Add Scripts to [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/package.json")**: To make it easy to lint and format your code, you can add scripts to your [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/package.json"):

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts",
  "format": "prettier --write ."
}
```

Now, you can run `npm run lint` to check for linting errors and `npm run format` to format your code using Prettier.

```
sjaca10: @terminal /explain #terminalSelection
```

Workspace: The error you're encountering, `TypeError [ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION]: Unknown file extension ".ts"`, suggests that Node.js is trying to directly execute a TypeScript (`.ts`) file, which it cannot do without being transpiled to JavaScript first. This is not directly related to ESLint but might be affecting how you're trying to run or lint your TypeScript files.

Given the context of your [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/package.json"), it seems like you're setting up a TypeScript project with ESLint for linting. Here are a few steps to address the issue:

1. **Ensure TypeScript is Installed**: Make sure you have TypeScript installed as a dev dependency. If it's not installed, you can add it by running:

```sh
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

2. **TypeScript Configuration**: Ensure you have a `tsconfig.json` file in your project root to configure TypeScript options. If you don't have one, you can generate it by running:

```sh
npx tsc --init
```

3. **Adjust ESLint Configuration**: Your ESLint command in the `scripts` section of [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/package.json") seems incorrect. It should target TypeScript files specifically and use the correct configuration file. Assuming you have an ESLint configuration file (e.g., `.eslintrc.js` or `.eslintrc.json`), update your lint script to:

```json
"lint": "eslint 'src/**/*.ts' --fix",
```

This tells ESLint to lint all TypeScript files in the `src` directory and subdirectories, and `--fix` attempts to automatically fix any fixable issues.

4. **Running TypeScript Files**: To run TypeScript files, you need to compile them to JavaScript first or use a tool like `ts-node` for direct execution. If you're trying to run your TypeScript application and encountering this error, consider using `ts-node` for development purposes:

```sh
npm install --save-dev ts-node
```

Then, you can add a script to your [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/package.json") to run your application with `ts-node`:

```json
"start:dev": "ts-node src/index.ts",
```

This setup should help you address the immediate issue with the unknown file extension error and improve your project's setup for working with TypeScript and ESLint.

Workspace: The error message `sh: ts-node: command not found` indicates that `ts-node` is not installed globally on your system or is not accessible in your project's local node_modules folder. `ts-node` is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js, allowing you to run TypeScript files directly without having to compile them to JavaScript first.

To resolve this issue, you can install `ts-node` either locally in your project or globally on your system. Here's how you can do it:

### Installing `ts-node` Locally

1. Open your project's root directory in the terminal.
2. Run the following command to install `ts-node` as a development dependency:

```sh
npm install --save-dev ts-node
```

3. After installation, try running your `start:dev` script again:

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

### Installing `ts-node` Globally

If you prefer to have `ts-node` available globally on your system, you can install it using the following command:

```sh
npm install -g ts-node
```

After installing it globally, you should be able to run `ts-node` from any terminal.

### Note

- Installing `ts-node` locally is generally recommended to ensure that your project's environment is self-contained and consistent across different development environments.
- If you install `ts-node` locally, make sure to run it through npm scripts (as you're doing with `npm run start:dev`) or use `npx` to execute it directly (e.g., `npx ts-node src/index.ts`), as this will ensure that the local version of `ts-node` is used.

```
sjaca10: @terminal /explain #terminalSelection
```

Workspace: The error you're encountering is due to a version conflict between `eslint` and `typescript-eslint`. Your project is using `eslint` version `9.6.0`, but `typescript-eslint` version `7.16.0` requires a peer dependency of `eslint` version `^8.56.0`. This means `typescript-eslint` is not compatible with `eslint` version `9.6.0` as of the versions you have specified.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

1. **Downgrade `eslint` to a compatible version**: You can downgrade `eslint` to a version that is compatible with `typescript-eslint@7.16.0`. Since `typescript-eslint@7.16.0` requires `eslint` version `^8.56.0`, you could install the latest `eslint` version `8.x.x` that satisfies this requirement.

```sh
npm install eslint@^8.56.0 --save-dev
```

2. **Upgrade `typescript-eslint`**: If there's a newer version of `typescript-eslint` that supports `eslint` version `9.6.0`, consider upgrading `typescript-eslint`. You would need to check the `typescript-eslint` documentation or npm page to see if such a version exists and is stable.

3. **Use `--legacy-peer-deps`**: If you're unable to change the versions due to other dependencies or project requirements, you can try installing your dependencies with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag. This tells npm to ignore peer dependency conflicts. However, this is not recommended as it may lead to runtime issues if the dependencies are truly incompatible.

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

4. **Check for alternative packages or updates**: Sometimes, the issue can be resolved by looking for alternative packages that do not have the same peer dependency issues or by checking if any of the conflicting packages have been updated to resolve the compatibility issues.

Before making any changes, ensure to check the compatibility of the new versions with the rest of your project to avoid introducing new issues.

If you're working on a Mac, ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running before executing this command. Here's how you can start your Docker Compose services:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing your [`docker-compose.yml`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fdocker-compose.yml%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/docker-compose.yml") file.
3. Run the following command:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

- To run the services in the background (detached mode), add the `-d` flag:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

- If you've made changes to your Dockerfile or the build context, and you want to rebuild the images before starting the containers, you can use:

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build the images if they don't exist or rebuild them if the Dockerfile has changed, and then start the containers.

sjaca10: How can I include a hot reload feature for an express app?
```

GitHub Copilot: To include a hot reload feature for an Express app, you can use `nodemon`. `Nodemon` is a utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Install `nodemon`**:
   - For local development, install `nodemon` as a dev dependency:
     ```sh
     npm install --save-dev nodemon
     ```

2. **Configure `nodemon`**:
   - You can configure `nodemon` by creating a `nodemon.json` file in your project root or by adding a `nodemonConfig` section in your `package.json`.
   - Here's an example `nodemon.json` configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "watch": ["src"],
       "ext": "ts,js,json",
       "exec": "ts-node ./src/index.ts"
     }
     ```
   - This configuration tells `nodemon` to watch the `src` directory for changes to files with `.ts`, `.js`, or `.json` extensions and to execute the app using `ts-node` for TypeScript support.

3. **Modify your `npm` start script**:
   - Adjust your `package.json` to use `nodemon` for your start script. If you're using TypeScript, ensure you have `ts-node` installed (`npm install --save-dev ts-node`) and use it in the script:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "start": "nodemon"
     }
     ```

4. **Run your app**:
   - Now, you can start your Express app with hot reload enabled by running:
     ```sh
     npm start
     ```

This setup will restart your Express server automatically whenever you make changes to your source code, improving your development workflow.

```
sjaca10: How can I include a hot reload feature for an express app with typescript using ts-node-dev?
```

GitHub Copilot: To include a hot reload feature for an Express app with TypeScript using `ts-node-dev`, follow these steps:

1. **Install `ts-node-dev`**:
   - `ts-node-dev` combines `ts-node` and `nodemon` to restart the app on file changes. It also compiles your TypeScript code.
   - Install `ts-node-dev` as a development dependency:
     ```sh
     npm install --save-dev ts-node-dev
     ```

2. **Modify your `npm` scripts**:
   - Update your `package.json` to include a script for starting your app with `ts-node-dev`. Here's an example:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/health.ts"
     }
     ```
   - The `--respawn` flag ensures the app restarts on file changes. The `--transpile-only` flag speeds up compilation by skipping type checks (since you would typically run type checks separately with `tsc`).

3. **Run your app**:
   - Start your Express app with the hot reload feature enabled by running:
     ```sh
     npm run dev
     ```
   - This command uses `ts-node-dev` to watch for file changes in your project and restarts the server automatically, speeding up your development process.

This setup will enable hot reloading for your TypeScript-based Express app, making development more efficient by automatically reloading your app upon changes.

```
sjaca10: How can I include a hot reload feature for an express app with typescript using ts-node?
```

GitHub Copilot: To include a hot reload feature for an Express app with TypeScript using `ts-node`, you can use `nodemon` with `ts-node` as a wrapper for TypeScript execution. Given the excerpt from your [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/package.json"), you'll first need to install `nodemon` if it's not already a part of your development dependencies.

1. **Install `nodemon`**:
   - Add `nodemon` to your development dependencies:
     ```sh
     npm install --save-dev nodemon
     ```

2. **Configure `nodemon` for TypeScript**:
   - Create a `nodemon.json` file in your project root or modify it if it already exists, to include TypeScript file watching and execution settings:
     ```json
     {
       "watch": ["src"],
       "ext": "ts",
       "ignore": ["src/**/*.spec.ts"],
       "exec": "ts-node src/index.ts"
     }
     ```
   - This configuration tells `nodemon` to watch the `src` directory for changes to `.ts` files, ignore test files (`*.spec.ts`), and execute the app using `ts-node`.

3. **Update your `npm` scripts**:
   - Modify your `package.json` to include a script for starting your app with `nodemon` and `ts-node`. Given your current scripts, you can update the `start:dev` script:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "lint": "eslint src/**/*.ts",
       "format": "prettier --write src/**/*.ts",
       "start:dev": "nodemon",
       "test": "jest"
     },
     ```
   - This change uses the `nodemon` configuration you've set up for TypeScript.

4. **Run your app with hot reload**:
   - Now, you can start your Express app with the hot reload feature enabled by running:
     ```sh
     npm run start:dev
     ```
   - `nodemon` will monitor your TypeScript files for changes and automatically restart the server, utilizing `ts-node` for execution.

This setup leverages `nodemon` and `ts-node` to enable hot reloading for your TypeScript-based Express app, improving your development workflow by automatically reloading your app upon changes.

This can help confirm whether the password is being loaded correctly.

```typescript


console

.log(process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD); // Debugging line
export const pool = new Pool({
  user: process.env.POSTGRES_USER,
  host: process.env.POSTGRES_HOST,
  database: process.env.POSTGRES_DATABASE,
  password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
  port: parseInt(process.env.POSTGRES_PORT || '5432'),
});
```

4. **Ensure String Format**: If the environment variable is present but there's still an issue, ensure that the password does not include characters that might be misinterpreted or require escaping in the context of environment variables. If the password is numeric or includes special characters, consider wrapping it in quotes in your `.env` file.

5. **Fallback Value**: As a temporary measure, you could provide a fallback value to ensure the code runs without this error, though this is not a solution for production environments.

```typescript

6. **Review [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/.env") File Loading**: If you're running your application in a way that might bypass the normal startup process (e.g., through a task runner or a testing framework), ensure that [`dotenv.config()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2Fdotenv%2Flib%2Fmain.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/dotenv/lib/main.d.ts") is still being called appropriately.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the `SASL: SCRAM-SERVER-FIRST-MESSAGE: client password must be a string` error.

sjaca10: Should the .env files must be versioned in git?
```

GitHub Copilot: No, `.env` files should not be versioned in git. They often contain sensitive information, such as database passwords and API keys, that should not be exposed publicly. Instead, you can create a `.env.example` file with the structure of the `.env` file but without the sensitive values, to be versioned in git. This serves as a template for other developers to create their own `.env` file locally.

```
sjaca10: Create a /tests folder in the backend project with a unit tests using Jest to verify the scenarios for the /health endpoint
```

GitHub Copilot: To create a `/tests` folder in the backend project with unit tests using Jest for the `/health` endpoint, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jest**: First, you need to install Jest and the necessary types for TypeScript (assuming your backend is using TypeScript based on the `devDependencies`).

2. **Configure Jest**: Set up Jest to work with TypeScript.

3. **Create Test File**: Create a test file for the `/health` endpoint inside the `/tests` folder.

4. **Write Tests**: Implement tests to verify the scenarios for the `/health` endpoint.

### Step-by-step in pseudocode:

1. **Install Jest and Supertest (for HTTP assertions)**:
   - Run `npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest supertest @types/supertest`.

2. **Configure Jest**:
   - Create a `jest.config.js` file in the project root.
   - Configure Jest to use `ts-jest` for TypeScript files.

3. **Create the `/tests` Folder and Test File**:
   - Create a folder named `/tests` in the root of the backend project.
   - Inside `/tests`, create a file named `health.test.ts`.

4. **Write Tests**:
   - Import necessary modules (`supertest` to make HTTP requests, your app/server instance).
   - Write tests for the `/health` endpoint, checking for a successful response and the expected response body.

### Implementation:

```bash
# Step 1: Install Jest and Supertest
npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest supertest @types/supertest
```

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
};
```

```typescript
// /tests/health.test.ts
import request from 'supertest';
import app from '../src/app'; // Adjust the import path to your actual app instance

describe('/health endpoint', () => {
  it('should return a 200 status and the correct body', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/health');
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body).toEqual({ status: 'up' }); // Adjust expected body as necessary
  });
});
```

```bash
# Add a test script to package.json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

After setting up, you can run your tests with `npm test`. This setup assumes your backend project is structured in a way that `app` or your server instance can be imported for testing purposes. Adjust file paths and expected responses as necessary to fit your project's specifics.

```
sjaca10: @workspace create a /tests folder in the backend project with a unit tests using Jest to verify the scenarios for the /health endpoint
```

Workspace: To create unit tests for the `/health` endpoint in the backend project using Jest, follow these steps:

1. Create a `tests` folder in the [`backend`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend") directory.
2. Inside the `tests` folder, create a file named [`health.test.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/application/services/health.ts").
3. Write the unit tests in [`health.test.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/application/services/health.ts") to verify the scenarios for the `/health` endpoint.

Here's an example of how the [`health.test.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/application/services/health.ts") file could look:

```typescript
import request from 'supertest';
import express from 'express';
import { router as healthRouter } from '../src/application/services/health';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use('/health', healthRouter);

describe('GET /health', () => {
  it('should return 200 OK when the database connection is successful', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/health');
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(response.text).toEqual('OK');
  });

  // This test assumes you have a way to simulate a database connection failure
  it('should return 500 Server connection failed when the database connection fails', async () => {
    // Mock or simulate a database connection failure here
    const response = await request(app).get('/health');
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(500);
    expect(response.text).toEqual('Server connection failed');
  });
});
```

This test file uses `supertest` to make HTTP requests to the express app. The express app is configured to use the `healthRouter` for the `/health` endpoint. The tests check that the endpoint returns a 200 status code with an "OK" response when the database connection is successful, and a 500 status code with a "Server connection failed" response when the database connection fails.

To run these tests, ensure you have `jest` and `supertest` installed in your `backend` project. If not, you can install them by running:

```sh
npm install --save-dev jest supertest
```

Then, you can run the tests by adding a test script in your [`backend/package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/package.json") (if not already present) and executing it:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

Run the tests with:

```sh
npm test
```

This setup assumes you have a way to simulate or mock the database connection's success and failure states. Depending on your application's architecture, you might need to adjust the test setup to properly mock these states.

```
sjaca10: Update the code to use got instead of supertest
```

GitHub Copilot: To update the code to use `got` instead of `supertest`, you'll need to adjust the testing approach slightly. `got` is a simpler HTTP request library and doesn't directly integrate with Express apps like `supertest`. Therefore, you'll need to start your Express app on a specific port during tests and make HTTP requests to that running instance. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install `got` for making HTTP requests.
2. Optionally, install `http-server` to easily start your Express app for testing.
3. Update the test code to start the server before tests and close it afterward.
4. Use `got` to make HTTP requests to the running server.

First, install `got`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev got
```

Then, update your test code:

```typescript
import express from 'express';
import { router as healthRouter } from '../../../application/services/health';
import got from 'got';
import { Server } from 'http';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use('/health', healthRouter);

describe('GET /health', () => {
  let server: Server;
  let baseURL: string;

  beforeAll((done) => {
    server = app.listen(0, () => {
      const port = (server.address() as any).port;
      baseURL = `http://localhost:${port}`;
      done();
    });
  });

  afterAll((done) => {
    server.close(done);
  });

  it('should return 200 OK when the database connection is successful', async () => {
    const response = await got(`${baseURL}/health`);
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body).toEqual('OK');
  });

  // This test assumes you have a way to simulate a database connection failure
  it('should return 500 Server connection failed when the database connection fails', async () => {
    // Mock or simulate a database connection failure here
    const response = await got(`${baseURL}/health`);
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(500);
    expect(response.body).toEqual('Server connection failed');
  });
});
```

This code dynamically starts the server on a free port before all tests run and closes it afterward. It uses `got` to make requests to the server. Note that `got` returns a promise with the response, which you can directly use in your assertions.

Remember, this approach requires your application to correctly handle starting and stopping the server, especially in a testing environment. Adjust the mock or simulation of the database connection failure as needed for your application's logic.

```
sjaca10: @workspace /explain Cannot find name 'beforeAll'.
```

Workspace: The code snippet you've provided is intended to be used within a Jest test suite, specifically within a `beforeAll` function to start an Express server before running tests. The error "Cannot find name 'beforeAll'" suggests that the context in which this code is being used is not recognized as part of a Jest test, or there might be an issue with the way the Jest types are being recognized in your project.

To resolve this issue, ensure the following:

1. **Correct Placement**: Make sure this code is placed inside a `describe` block in a test file (usually with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extension). The `beforeAll` function should wrap your code to ensure the server starts before all tests run.

2. **TypeScript Configuration**: Ensure your `tsconfig.json` is properly set up for Jest. You might need to include Jest type definitions in your `types` array within `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["jest"],
    // other options...
  }
}
```

3. **Jest Configuration**: Verify that Jest is properly set up in your project. If you're using TypeScript, you might be using `ts-jest`. Ensure your Jest configuration (in `jest.config.js` or `package.json`) is correctly pointing to your test files and properly set up for TypeScript.

4. **Installation of Types**: Make sure you have the Jest types installed for TypeScript to recognize Jest-specific globals like `beforeAll`. You can install them using npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @types/jest
```

or

```sh
yarn add --dev @types/jest
```

Here's how you might correctly use your code snippet within a Jest test file:

```typescript
describe('My Server Tests', () => {
  let server:

 any

;
  let baseURL: string;

  beforeAll(done => {
    server = app.listen(0, () => {
      const address = server.address();
      const port = typeof address === 'string' ? address : address?.port;
      baseURL = `http://localhost:${port}`;
      done();
    });
  });

  afterAll(() => {
    server.close();
  });

  // Your tests go here, using [`baseURL`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.test.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.test.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.test.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "backend/src/tests/application/services/health.test.ts") to make requests to the server
});
```

This setup includes a `beforeAll` to start the server and an `afterAll` to close the server after tests complete, preventing open handles from keeping Jest from exiting.

```
sjaca10: The tsconfig.json file is missing. Generate one with standard configuration and jest
```

GitHub Copilot: To create a `tsconfig.json` file with a standard configuration that includes Jest, you can follow these steps:

1. **Compiler Options**: Set up the compiler options for general TypeScript usage.
2. **Include Jest Types**: Include Jest type definitions to help TypeScript understand Jest functions and hooks.
3. **Include & Exclude**: Specify which files to include and exclude from the TypeScript compilation.

Here's a basic `tsconfig.json` that meets these requirements:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "lib": ["es6", "dom"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "types": ["jest"],
    "noEmit": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"]
}
```

This configuration does the following:

- Compiles TypeScript code targeting ECMAScript 6 with CommonJS modules.
- Includes the standard library for ES6 and DOM manipulations.
- Allows JavaScript files to be compiled alongside TypeScript.
- Outputs compiled files to a `dist` directory, assuming source files are in a `src` directory.
- Enforces strict type-checking options for better code safety.
- Resolves modules using Node.js resolution strategy.
- Enables compatibility with ES modules.
- Skips type checking of declaration files to speed up the compilation.
- Ensures file names are case-consistent across imports.
- Includes Jest types for testing.
- Does not emit output files (`noEmit` is true, useful for when using TypeScript only for type-checking in a Node.js project).
- Includes files from the `src` and `tests` directories for compilation.
- Excludes `node_modules` and `dist` directories from the compilation process.

Make sure to adjust paths and options according to your project's structure and requirements.

sjaca10: Update the code to use ky instead of got

GitHub Copilot: To update the code to use `ky` instead of [`got`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.spec.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.spec.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.spec.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/tests/application/services/health.spec.ts"), you'll need to make a few adjustments. `ky` is primarily designed for use in the browser and relies on the `fetch` API, but it can also be used in Node.js environments with a bit of setup. Since `ky` is promise-based, similar to [`got`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.spec.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.spec.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.spec.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/tests/application/services/health.spec.ts"), the transition will be straightforward for making HTTP requests. However, you'll need to ensure you're using `ky-universal` or a similar package that provides `ky` functionality in Node.js environments.

First, install `ky-universal`:

```bash
npm install ky-universal
```

Then, update your test code:

```typescript
import ky from 'ky-universal';
import { Server } from 'http';
import express from 'express';
import { router as healthRouter } from '../../../application/services/health';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use('/health', healthRouter);

      done();
    });
  });

  afterAll((done) => {
    server.close(done);
  });

  it('should return 200 OK when the database connection is successful', async () => {
    const response = await ky(`${baseURL}/health`).then(res => res.text());
    expect(response).toEqual('OK');
  });

  // This test assumes you have a way to simulate a database connection failure
  it('should return 500 Server connection failed when the database connection fails', async () => {
    // Mock or simulate a database connection failure here
    try {
      await ky(`${baseURL}/health`);
    } catch (error) {
      const { response } = error;
      expect(response.status).toBe(500);
      const text = await response.text();
      expect(text).toEqual('Server connection failed');
    }
  });
});
```

Key changes include:
- Importing `ky` from `ky-universal` instead of [`got`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.spec.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.spec.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.spec.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/tests/application/services/health.spec.ts").
- Using `ky` for making HTTP requests. Note that `ky` returns a `Response` object, similar to the Fetch API, so you'll use `.then(res => res.text())` to read the response body as text.
- Handling errors with `ky` involves catching exceptions. `ky` throws when the response status code is not in the 2xx range, so you catch the error and inspect the `error.response` property.

This updated code uses `ky` for HTTP requests in your tests, assuming the server setup and teardown logic remains the same.

```
sjaca10: @workspace /explain Property 'response' does not exist on type 'unknown'.
```

Workspace: The error message "Property 'response' does not exist on type 'unknown'" typically occurs when TypeScript cannot determine the exact type of a variable, and you're trying to access a property on it that TypeScript doesn't know exists. This often happens in the context of handling responses in tests, especially when using libraries like `supertest` with Express.

Given the context of your [`health.spec.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Ftests%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.spec.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/src/tests/application/services/health.spec.ts") file, it seems like the error might occur in a part of the code where you're trying to access the `response` property of a result from a request made with `supertest`. However, the provided excerpt doesn't include the part where you're accessing the `response` property. Still, I can guide you on how to address this issue based on common scenarios.

When using `supertest` to test Express routes, you might have code that looks something like this:

```typescript
it('should do something', async () => {
  const result = await request(app).get('/some-route');
  console.log(result.response);
});
```

If `result` is implicitly typed as `unknown`, TypeScript will complain when you try to access `result.response`. However, `supertest` request methods actually return a `SuperTest<Test>` type, and the result of calling `.get()`, `.post()`, etc., is usually typed as `Response` from `supertest`.

To fix the issue, ensure you're importing the `Response` type from `supertest` and using it to type the result of your request. Here's how you can adjust the code:

```typescript
import request, { Response } from 'supertest';
// Other imports...

it('should do something', async () => {
  const result: Response = await request(app).get('/some-route');
  console.log(result.body); // Assuming you meant to access the body of the response
});
```

In this corrected version, `result` is explicitly typed as `Response`, which has properties like `body`, `status`, `headers`, etc., that you can safely access without TypeScript errors.

If you're dealing with a situation where TypeScript cannot infer the correct type, explicitly typing your variables as shown above should help resolve the "Property 'response' does not exist on type 'unknown'" error.

Workspace: The error message you're encountering, "SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module," typically occurs in Node.js environments when you try to use ES module syntax (`import`/`export`) in a context that Node.js expects CommonJS syntax (`require`/`module.exports`). This can happen for several reasons, such as the type of JavaScript file not being recognized as a module by Node.js, or your Node.js version not supporting ES modules without specific configuration.

Here are a few ways to resolve this issue:

### 1. Ensure Your File is Treated as a Module
For Node.js to treat your JavaScript files as ES modules, you can do one of the following:
- Rename your file to have a `.mjs` extension if you're mixing CommonJS and ES modules in your project.
- Add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`. This will treat all `.js` files in your project as ES modules.

### 2. Use CommonJS Syntax
If you're working in a CommonJS environment or prefer not to use ES modules, you can convert the import statement to CommonJS syntax:
```javascript
const Ky = require('./core/Ky.js');
```

### 3. Upgrade Node.js Version
Ensure you're using a Node.js version that supports ES modules. While early support started around Node.js 12, more stable support is available in Node.js 14 and later. Upgrading to a newer version might help if your current version is outdated.

### 4. Use a Transpiler
If you're working in an environment that doesn't support ES modules and you cannot change the module system (for example, due to compatibility reasons), consider using a transpiler like Babel. This will allow you to write your code using ES module syntax, and Babel will convert it to a syntax compatible with your environment.

### 5. Check for Misconfiguration
If you're already using Node.js with the correct configuration for ES modules, ensure there's no misconfiguration in your project setup. This could involve checking your `package.json`, ensuring you're not accidentally running your code with an incorrect Node.js command or flag, and making sure there are no conflicting configurations in your project.

To decide which solution is best for you, consider your project's requirements, the environments you're targeting, and whether you're mixing module systems.

    SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module"
```

GitHub Copilot: Given the [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/tsconfig.json") configuration you've shared, your TypeScript project is set up to compile TypeScript files from the `src` directory into JavaScript files in the `dist` directory, using CommonJS modules (`"module": "commonjs"`). However, the error you're encountering suggests that Node.js is trying to run a file directly that uses ES module syntax (`import`/`export`), which is not directly compatible with the CommonJS module system configured in your [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/tsconfig.json").

To fix the "Cannot use import statement outside a module" error in this context, you have a few options:

### 1. Use TypeScript to Compile Your Code
Ensure you're compiling your TypeScript code to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) before running it with Node.js. The compiled JavaScript will use `require` statements instead of `import` statements, which should be compatible with Node.js configured for CommonJS modules.

- Run the TypeScript compiler: `npx tsc`
- Then run your compiled JavaScript with Node.js: `node dist/yourEntryPoint.js`

### 2. Adjust Your Node.js Command to Support ES Modules
If you intend to use ES modules directly in Node.js (for JavaScript files), you can do the following:

- Rename your `.js` files to `.mjs` if you want to explicitly use ES modules.
- Or, add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`. This will treat all `.js` files as ES modules.

This approach is more relevant if you're encountering the error in JavaScript files that are not being compiled from TypeScript.

### 3. Modify Your TypeScript Configuration for ES Modules
If you want your TypeScript project to output ES modules instead of CommonJS modules, you can modify your [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/jav/workspace/AI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA/backend/tsconfig.json"):

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "esnext", // Change this from "commonjs" to "esnext"
    // other options remain the same
  }
  // include and exclude remain the same
}
```

After making this change, you'll need to ensure your environment supports ES modules. For Node.js, this might involve using `.mjs` extensions for your output JavaScript files or setting `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.

### 4. Ensure Correct File References
If the issue is specifically with importing a file (`import { Ky } from './core/Ky.js';`), ensure that:
- The file path is correct.
- The file `Ky.js` is being compiled correctly if it's a TypeScript file, or if it's a JavaScript file, that it's compatible with your module system.

### Summary
The best approach depends on your project setup and goals:
- If you're working with TypeScript and compiling to JavaScript, ensure you're running the compiled JavaScript files with Node.js.
- If you want to use ES modules directly in Node.js, adjust your project to support ES modules either by renaming files to `.mjs` or by setting `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.
- If you want your TypeScript output to be ES modules, adjust your `tsconfig.json` to output ES modules.

Workspace: The error message you're encountering indicates that Jest is having trouble parsing a file due to encountering an unexpected token. This is commonly due to syntax that Jest does not understand out of the box, such as ECMAScript Modules (ESM) or TypeScript. The specific error points to the use of an `import` statement in a dependency (`ky` module), which suggests that the issue is related to ESM syntax.

Given that your project is using TypeScript (as indicated by the [`preset: 'ts-jest'`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40jest%2Ftypes%2Fbuild%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A803%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/@jest/types/build/index.d.ts") in your Jest configuration), here are a few steps to address the issue:

1. **Ensure `ts-jest` is properly configured**: Your Jest configuration file already specifies [`preset: 'ts-jest'`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40jest%2Ftypes%2Fbuild%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A803%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/@jest/types/build/index.d.ts"), which is intended to handle TypeScript files. Make sure you have `ts-jest` installed in your project.

2. **Configure Jest to transform `node_modules` dependencies**: By default, Jest does not transform files within `node_modules`. Since the error is occurring in a `node_modules` package (`ky`), you might need to adjust the `transformIgnorePatterns` option in your Jest configuration to allow Jest to transform this package. For example:

   ```typescript
   transformIgnorePatterns: [
     "/node_modules/(?!(ky)/)"
   ],
   ```

   This configuration tells Jest to transform files in the `node_modules/ky` directory while still ignoring the rest of `node_modules`.

3. **Ensure your environment supports ESM**: If your project uses ESM, ensure your environment is configured to support it. This might involve setting `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` or using `.mjs` extensions for your modules. However, this is more about how Node.js treats your files and may not be directly related to the Jest issue.

4. **Check for Babel configuration**: If your project uses Babel for additional transformations, ensure your Babel configuration is compatible with the syntax you're using. Since the error message mentions Babel, Jest might be trying to use it to transform files. Ensure your Babel setup includes plugins or presets necessary for handling the syntax used by your dependencies.

If after trying these steps you're still encountering issues, you might want to create a minimal reproducible example and consult the Jest documentation or seek help from the community. Debugging configuration issues can sometimes require a bit of trial and error to pinpoint the exact cause.

GitHub Copilot: To mock `pg`'s [`query`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Fpg%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A192%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/@types/pg/index.d.ts") method using Jest, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jest and Types for Node (if not already installed)**: Ensure you have Jest and the necessary types for Node.js installed in your project. If not, you can install them using npm or yarn.

2. **Create a Jest Setup File**: If you don't already have a Jest setup file, create one. This file is used to configure Jest and set up global mocks. You can specify this file in your Jest configuration under the `setupFilesAfterEnv` property.

3. **Mock the `pg` Module**: In your Jest setup file or directly in your test file, use `jest.mock()` to mock the `pg` module, specifically the [`pool.query`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finfrastructure%2Fdatabase%2Fdb.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/infrastructure/database/db.ts") method. You'll replace the implementation of [`query`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Fpg%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A192%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/@types/pg/index.d.ts") with a mock function that simulates the behavior you need for your tests.

Here's an example of how you might set this up:

### Step 1: Install Jest and Types for Node.js

If you haven't already, install Jest and the types for Node.js:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest @types/node
```

### Step 2: Create or Update Jest Configuration

Ensure your `jest.config.js` file includes a setup file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Other configuration options...
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
};
```

### Step 3: Mock `pg` in Your Jest Setup File

In your `jest.setup.js` file (or whatever file you've specified in your Jest configuration), add the following to mock the `pg` module:

```javascript
jest.mock('../../infrastructure/database/db', () => ({
  pool: {
    query: jest.fn(),
  },
}));
```

### Step 4: Write Your Test

Now, in your test file for the `health.ts` route, you can control the behavior of `pool.query` using Jest's mocking capabilities:

```typescript
import { router } from './path/to/health';
import { pool } from '../../infrastructure/database/db';
import request from 'supertest';

// Assuming express app is imported or created here as `app`
// and [`router`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Fapplication%2Fservices%2Fhealth.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/application/services/health.ts") is used with `app.use('/health', router);`

describe('GET /health', () => {
  it('responds with OK if the database query succeeds', async () => {
    (pool.query as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({ rows: [{ 'SELECT 1': 1 }] });
    const response = await request(app).get('/health');
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
    expect(response.text).toBe('OK');
  });

  it('responds with Server connection failed if the database query fails', async () => {
    (pool.query as jest.Mock).mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('Query failed'));
    const response = await request(app).get('/health');
    expect(response.statusCode).toBe(500);
    expect(response.text).toBe('Server connection failed');
  });
});
```

This example demonstrates how to mock the [`pool.query`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fsrc%2Finfrastructure%2Fdatabase%2Fdb.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/src/infrastructure/database/db.ts") method for both successful and failed queries, allowing you to test how your route handles these scenarios.

```
sjaca10: Mock pg library query method using jest
```

GitHub Copilot: To mock the `pg` library's `query` method using Jest, follow these steps:

1. **Mock the `pg` Module**: Use `jest.mock` to mock the entire `pg` module. This allows you to replace the `query` method with a mock function.

2. **Implement the Mock**: Inside the mock implementation, specify how the `query` method should behave. You can make it return a promise that resolves to a specific value, mimicking a successful database query, or rejects to simulate a failure.

3. **Use the Mock in Tests**: In your tests, you can further customize the behavior of the `query` mock for different scenarios using `mockResolvedValue` to simulate successful queries or `mockRejectedValue` to simulate errors.

Here's an example in TypeScript:

```typescript
// At the top of your test file, mock the `pg` module
jest.mock('pg', () => {
  return {
    Pool: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => {
      return {
        query: jest.fn(),
      };
    }),
  };
});

describe('Database interactions', () => {
  it('should handle a successful query', async () => {
    const { Pool } = require('pg');
    const mockData = { rows: [{ id: 1, name: 'Test' }] };
    Pool.prototype.query.mockResolvedValue(mockData);

    // Assuming `databaseQueryFunction` is the function you're testing
    // that internally calls `pool.query`
    const result = await databaseQueryFunction();
    expect(result).toEqual(mockData.rows);
  });

  it('should handle a failed query', async () => {
    const { Pool } = require('pg');
    Pool.prototype.query.mockRejectedValue(new Error('Query failed'));

    await expect(databaseQueryFunction()).rejects.toThrow('Query failed');
  });
});
```

This example demonstrates how to set up a basic mock for the `pg` library's `query` method, allowing you to test both success and failure scenarios in your application's database interactions.

```
sjaca10: How can I mock a specific result for a query using the `pg` library in Jest?
```

GitHub Copilot: To mock a specific result for a query using the `pg` library in Jest, you can follow these steps:

1. **Mock the `pg` Module**: Use `jest.mock` to mock the `pg` module at the top of your test file.

2. **Setup Mock Implementation**: Inside the mock, provide a specific implementation for the `query` method that returns a promise resolving to the specific result you want to simulate.

3. **Use the Mock in Your Test**: In your test, when the `query` method is called, it will use the mocked implementation and return the specific result you've set up.

Here's an example in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Mock the pg module
jest.mock('pg', () => {
  const mPool = {
    query: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
      rows: [{ id: 1, name: 'Test User' }], // Mock specific result here
    }),
  };
  return { Pool: jest.fn(() => mPool) };
});

describe('Database Query Tests', () => {
  it('should return 200 OK when the database connection is successful', async () => {
    // Assuming `getUser` is a function that makes a query to the database
    const result = await getUser(1);
    expect(result).toEqual([{ id: 1, name: 'Test User' }]);
    // Verify the query was called as expected
    const { Pool } = require('pg');
    expect(Pool().query).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.any(String), expect.any(Array));
  });
});
```

In this example, the `pg` module is mocked so that any call to `Pool().query` within your application will return a promise that resolves to the specific result you've defined in the mock implementation. This allows you to test how your application code handles the result of a database query without needing to connect to an actual database.

```

Workspace: The error message you're encountering indicates a type mismatch between what you're providing and what is expected by a function or constructor that expects a `PoolConfig` object or `undefined`, and should return a `Pool` instance. This typically occurs when you're trying to mock or stub a PostgreSQL `Pool` using a testing framework like Jest, but the mock does not fully implement the `Pool` interface required by the PostgreSQL client in Node.js.

Here's a breakdown of the error and how you might resolve it:

### Understanding the Error

- **Expected Parameter**: The function or constructor you're trying to use expects an argument that is either a `PoolConfig` object or `undefined`. This argument is used to configure a PostgreSQL connection pool.
- **Provided Argument**: You're providing an object that includes a `Pool` property with various fields, including a mocked `query` method and other properties. However, this object does not match the expected `Pool` interface from the `pg` library.
- **Missing Properties**: The error message lists several properties (`totalCount`, `idleCount`, `waitingCount`, `connect`, etc.) that are missing from your mock but are part of the `Pool` interface.

### Solution

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that your mock or stub of the PostgreSQL `Pool` matches the expected interface. If you're using Jest for mocking, here's an example of how you might mock the `Pool` more accurately:

```typescript
import { Pool } from 'pg';
jest.mock('pg', () => {
  const originalModule = jest.requireActual('pg');

  // Mock the entire Pool class with jest.fn() but restore the original implementation of the Pool constructor
  return {
    ...originalModule,
    Pool: jest.fn().mockImplementation((config) => ({
      query: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ rows: [], rowCount: 0 }),
      // Add other methods and properties as needed
      connect: jest.fn(),
      end: jest.fn(),
      // Mock other properties and methods as needed to match the Pool interface
    })),
  };
});
```

This example uses `jest.mock` to mock the `pg` module, specifically the `Pool` class. It uses `jest.fn().mockImplementation` to provide a custom implementation for the `Pool` constructor, ensuring that the mock includes the necessary methods and properties to match the `Pool` interface.

- **Note**: The exact methods and properties you need to mock will depend on how your code interacts with the `Pool` instance. Ensure you mock all methods and properties that your code uses.

By ensuring your mock closely matches the expected interface, you should be able to resolve the type mismatch error. Remember, the goal of mocking in tests is to replicate the behavior of real objects in a controlled way, so your mocks should provide the necessary functionality for your tests to run as expected.

To correctly mock the [`pg.Pool`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Fpg%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/@types/pg/index.d.ts") for your test scenario, you need to ensure that the mock implementation returns an object that closely mimics the actual [`Pool`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Fpg%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A163%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/@types/pg/index.d.ts") interface, including the methods and properties your code interacts with. Here's how you can adjust your test to properly mock the [`pg.Pool`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fjav%2Fworkspace%2FAI4Devs-LTI-ATS-JACA%2Fbackend%2Fnode_modules%2F%40types%2Fpg%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "backend/node_modules/@types/pg/index.d.ts"):

```typescript
import * as pg from 'pg';

// Mock implementation before your tests
jest.mock('pg', () => {
  const originalModule = jest.requireActual('pg');

  // Mock the Pool class
  return {
    ...originalModule,
    Pool: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
      // Mock methods and properties as needed
      connect: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
      query: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ rows: [], rowCount: 0 }),
      end: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
      // Add other methods and properties as needed
    })),
  };
});

// Your tests here
```

This approach uses `jest.mock` to replace the `pg.Pool` class with a custom mock implementation. The `jest.fn().mockImplementation` is used to define what the mock constructor should do when it's instantiated. Inside the mock implementation, you can define mock methods (`connect`, `query`, `end`, etc.) that your application code calls. This way, when your test runs and it creates a new `pg.Pool` instance, it will use this mocked version instead of the real one, allowing you to control the behavior of these methods for testing purposes.

Remember to adjust the mock implementation to fit the specific needs of your tests. For example, if your code checks the result of a query, make sure to mock the `query` method to return a value that matches what your code expects.
